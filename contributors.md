The Hackathon Organizer Guide is a collaborative effort between Major League Hacking and hackathon organizers all over the world who are a part of our community. This guide serves as our mutual belief that hackers deserve to be able to attend well-organized hackathons and that you can still throw amazing hackathons whether it's your first or your hundredth hackathon.
