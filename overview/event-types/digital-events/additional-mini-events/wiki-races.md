# Wiki Races

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom/ Video streaming service
* Any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles
* You can use websites such as https://www.thewikigame.com/  or https://wikispeedruns.com/ to run this game.

## **Wikipedia Races:**

The objective of this game is to try to get to a target Wikipedia article as quickly as possible using only links from your starting article and without any searches.

For example, let’s say Kevin announces the target article is “Texas Hold ‘Em.” After that, all participants will go to their Wikipedia homepage, and click on the “Random article” link on the left hand side, or, start from a pre-decided wikipedia page and the races will begin!

And after many control f’s and several clicks, we got to the endpoint!

Feel free to repeat the races as many times as time permits, as long as hackers are engaged and having fun.


## **Running the mini event**

* Choose a starting and ending article on Wikipedia
* Let attendees try to navigate their way from the start page to the end page in \~5 minutes.&#x20;
* Once a path has been found, ask them to go back into their search history and share with others how they got there.

## **Pro tips:**

* Countries are a very easy first race
* Narrow down to make it harder, such as a celebrity
* If hackers finish at the same time, use # of clicks to clinch tiebreakers
