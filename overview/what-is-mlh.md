# What is MLH?

Major League Hacking (MLH) is the official student hackathon league. Each year, we power over [200 weekend-long hackathons](http://mlh.io/events) that inspire innovation, cultivate communities and teach computer science skills to more than **65,000 students** around the world. MLH is an engaged and passionate maker community, consisting of the next generation of technology leaders and entrepreneurs.

At Major League Hacking, our goal is to give you the tools to throw the best hackathon humanly possible, which is why MLH Member events get various benefits like:

* Mentorship and Support
* Templates and Tutorials
* Preferred Vendors and Discounts
* Onsite Hackathon Support
* Mini-Events
* Judging Support
* Prizes
* Software Lab

(You can see the full list [here](https://mlh.io/event-membership). )

The sooner your hackathon applies for membership, the more time youâ€™ll have to take advantage of all MLH benefits. To [apply](https://mlh.io/event-membership), it must be _at least_ 3-4 months before your event.

Throughout your planning process, you will be supported by a Hackathon Community Manager (HCM) from MLH to help answer any questions, talk through challenges, and brainstorm new ideas.

During your event, an MLHer (called a Coach) will be on-site to help you and your team with whatever you need. MLHers are event organizers themselves and receive extensive training to become an asset to your team.
