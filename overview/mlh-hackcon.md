# MLH Hackcon

[MLH Hackcon](https://hackcon.mlh.io) is an in-person conference that takes place each year in upstate New York and teaches organizers skills to build their communities and hackathons. With our schedule of discussions, lightning talks, and fun campground activities, you'll get to adopt best practices and expand your perspective on what hackathon planning looks like with teams from all around the world. Attending Hackcon with your organizing team is a great way to align your vision for your event and give you all a core memory to bond over.

The best part about Hackcon is that it's run by organizers, for organizers! Most of our talks come from organizers who want to share what they've learned from their experiences. If you have a topic you'd like to bring to Hackcon, our [speaker applications are currently open](https://majorleaguehacking.typeform.com/to/oBbi87uP?typeform-source=hackcon.mlh.io) until the end of April. Selected speakers are also reimbursed for their ticket.
