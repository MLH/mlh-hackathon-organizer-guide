# Introduction

#### Welcome to the MLH Hackathon Organizer Guide! This is a community initiative by [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io) that contains a lot of the lessons that we and the hackathon community around the world have learned from organizing hackathons — all in a single student hackathon playbook.

Take a look and learn some of the practices used by hackathon organizers all around the world. This guide should contain most, if not all, of the practices you need to throw a great hackathon.

**Disclaimer:** The hackathon organizer guide is never finished. It's an ongoing project that we're always trying to update as we and the global hackathon organizer community learn. Try everything, contribute your learnings back to the guide with a pull request over on [our GitHub repository for this guide](https://github.com/mlh/hackathon-organizer-guide).
