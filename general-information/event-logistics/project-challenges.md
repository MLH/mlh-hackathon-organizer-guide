# Project Challenges

Every event has different ways to engage hackers. Having challenges for specific topics can help hackers come up with where to get started on what type of project they want to make, and can encourage them to try out things they would not have considered before. Challenges like this are usually only one winner, and you should try and make sure 1 team is not the winner of multiple tracks where possible.&#x20;

You should try and have sponsors or partners provide these challenges where possible. Not only does it keep your budget down, it also gets them directly involved! You also want to avoid having 20 different tracks at your event, as judging will quickly get messy. You should aim for 3 tracks if you have no sponsor tracks and are not doing an overall 1st, 2nd, 3rd. If sponsors/partners are helping with judging you can have more, but be cognizant of how chaotic judging deliberations can be with many categories.&#x20;

Let's review some example challenges and descriptions

* Best Sustainability Hack
  * This sustainability challenge invites you to develop a hack that provides an innovative and practical solution that promote sustainable development.
* Best Accessibility Hack
  * This accessibility challenge invites you to develop a hack that promotes accessibility and inclusion for people.

* Best Engagement
  *   This challenge is for the attendee/s that attend the most events during the hackathon. Events include workshops, keynotes, career fairs, and fun activities. If it is on the schedule, then it counts towards this challenge!

      The purpose of this challenge is to show our hackers that you don't need to build a project at a hackathon to participate and have fun.

  * For the thrown together "If it isn't broke don't touch it" projects
  * Have a screwdriver for the prize as a fun themed tie in.&#x20;
