# Setup your Event

#### Things to Print Before

* Signage -some pointing left, right, or blank so you can fill in the arrow as you place them
  * Checkin (include some pointing up to put on glass doors or in an elevator)
  * Bathrooms
  * Hacker Space
  * Food/Snacks
  * Mentors
  * Organizers Only
  * Do Not Enter
  * Workshops
* Lanyards- having different colors or designs helps differentiate hackers from staff
  * Organizers
  * Volunteers
  * Mentors
  * Judges
  * Sponsors
  * Hackers
  * Blank(if the above run out for some reason have 10-15 blank)
* Parking Passes(if needed)
* Minor Forms(if needed)
* Table Numbers (for Judging) - better to over than under print these

#### Before the Event

Here are common supplies you should have for your hackathon

* First Aid Kit&#x20;
* Permanent Markers&#x20;
* Paper&#x20;
  * Last minute signage&#x20;
  * Give out wifi&#x20;
  * Parking passes&#x20;
  * Link to Discord&#x20;
* Box Cutters / Scissors&#x20;
  * To open all your/your sponsors swag&#x20;
* Painters Tape&#x20;
  * Do not use Scotch tape on paint. It will rip away the paint and make your venue mad. It also is not likely to last the full event&#x20;
* Gaffer's Tape&#x20;
  * Secure electrical cords if they absolutely have to be across walkways&#x20;
* Duct Tape&#x20;
  * Jack of all trades tape. DO NOT USE ON PAINT

It's important to check that the various tools you're using for your event are ready to go day-of. A dry run of the whole event largely can also help your team be prepared to handle everything and let you know about any bottleneck that might create problems later on.
