# Help Desk Recommendations

Communication is key. Be it the hackers, sponsors, judges, mentors or even organizers!

## **Organizer On Call**

Have a help desk / organizer table setup at all times. Tell hackers and sponsors they can stop by to ask questions or just hang out. Having a central location helps guide hackers who need help at any time during the event.&#x20;

## **Announcing Updates**

The help desk can also be in charge of sending updates into your chat channel throughout the event. Remind people when activities are happening and share highlights from your activities! Expect questions to pop us as you announce an event, so give some buffer time for questions.&#x20;

Donâ€™t forget to set up Discord roles to show if someone is an organizer, hacker, sponsor, or mentor. If you're using Slack, you can utilize statuses for this information.
