# Making an Accessible Design

You want your event to be memorable and unique. Choosing a fun mascot and colors that go well together can let you create a fun website that you can also tie in with your in person decorations. When choosing there are a few things to consider. Is your design easily printed? Or is it super detailed and hard to make out when small? Are the colors easy for the colorblind to see? Do they have enough contrast?

Here are a few places you can check your design on. Make sure you have enough contrast that your design is easily readable.&#x20;
