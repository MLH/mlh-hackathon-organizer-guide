# Using DoraHacks

{% hint style="info" %}
This platform does not currently meet [MLH export requirements](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/set-up-your-hackathon-portal), so you will have to manually add the missing fields or do a secondary form as a workaround.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Setting up your DoraHacks hackathon page will help you manage your project submissions, judging, and assigning winners. Please follow this guide on [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/diy-your-hackathon/) for step by step instructions.

If you decide to use DoraHacks and are applying to be an MLH member event, please ensure the following:

1. Reach out to your Hackathon Community Manager at MLH for help getting DoraHacks set up within the MLH requirements.
2. Similar to Devfolio, DoraHacks has an approval process that your event needs to go through before you can publish it live. Make sure to work ahead of time to be approved so you can customize as needed.
3. You need to create the hackathon as an organization. If you don’t have an organization yet, create one first.
4. As the platform doesn’t support questions other than text type, we require you to use a platform, such as [OrganizerHQ](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/managing-registrations/free-registration-tool-organizerhq-ohq) or others, that allow you to add [MLH mandated registration fields and checkboxes](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/managing-registrations/registration-timelines#important-registration-fields) for registrations. DoraHacks has a field where you can enter this registration link, and disable registration on their platform.&#x20;

5. Please confirm that the submission requirements and rules for your event have been added correctly. [https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/rules-for-your-hackathon](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/rules-for-your-hackathon)&#x20;
6. Make sure you understand what the difference between tracks and bounties are on DoraHacks. Once you become a Member Event, we’ll send you more information on the MLH partners that are active at your event.&#x20;
   1. **Tracks: A submitted project can belong to only one of the tracks**, e.g software or hardware. Every hackathon initially has a default track, “All BUIDLs”. You can rename it, and you can also add more custom tracks. If Hackers can participate in multiple tracks, you need to make 1 General Track and instead have your tracks listed as bounties.&#x20;
   2. **Bounties**: Bounties are the opt-in prize categories.&#x20;
      1. ‘Necessity of bounty applications’ is for you to choose whether it’s mandatory for teams to select a category prize to make a successful submission.
      2. ‘Maximum number of bounties each BUIDL can apply for’ is the maximum prize categories that a team can opt-in to. You should ideally leave this field empty to let teams opt-in to as many categories as they wish to.
      3. Your organization is a default sponsor and is considered to have a prize category. If you don’t have one, you should list your overall prizes.
      4. Add each MLH partner category prize as a new bounty.
7. Add custom submission questions from Overview -> BUIDL submission tab.
   1. Links or other information relevant to MLH category prizes they opt-in to. Example - domain name that the team redeemed if a domain partner was active at your event.&#x20;
   2. Share feedback about any technology you interacted with at this hackathon. Remember to mention what tech you're reviewing (e.g. MongoDB, GitHub, Auth0, etc.).&#x20;
   3.  Schools of all the team members (used in our Season competition).&#x20;

8. DoraHacks project exports currently don’t include information such as project demo links and details of team members so make sure to practice exporting data from DoraHacks for judging. The platform does not currently meet [MLH export requirements](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/judging-and-submissions/set-up-your-hackathon-portal), so you will have to manually add the missing fields or do a secondary form as a workaround.&#x20;
