# Hackathon Submission Portal

Hackathon portals are one of the most important needs for any hackathon to get the projects submitted in the right way. Though one might think that these portals are just working as a form collecting data from the attendees to showcase the project, using a simple form can be a big problem in terms of judging a hackathon!

Hackathon portals provide separate pages for judges to look over the different details of the project, providing hackers with a page where they can fill in details and publish their projects in front of the world! Other than that, various tools and services these portals provide are a great way to enhance the overall hacking and organizing experience for everyone involved!

While there are a ton of different platforms to use for judging, Devpost is the most common at MLH Hackathons.
