# Locking Down a Venue

Few of your planning decisions will truly make or break your hackathon, but your choice of venue is one of them. It often takes more time than expected to secure the right location, so the earlier you begin scouting, the better! Having a confirmed venue will also prove to potential sponsors and attendees that you’re serious about hosting a great event.

Keep in mind your venue should be **free.** In most cases, you _should_ be able to find a university or company sponsored space.

### Research Venues on Your Campus

On-campus venues are best because they’re accessible to your hackers and are usually free. Research past events at your school to get a sense of each venue's capabilities. Do they meet your hackathon’s requirements? Make a list of your favorites after considering pros and cons.

Note: Each venue usually has one university representative who oversees bookings. One shortcut to finding them is contacting students who previously held events at that space and asking how they recommend you proceed.

### Enlist a Campus Advocate to Help You Navigate the Bureaucracy

A university advocate, such as a professor or dean, can significantly simplify your venue search by helping you navigate your school’s unique booking process.

In most cases, this person will be your organization’s advisor. You should have a quick elevator pitch that everyone on your organizing committee can give to campus representatives you'll be working with ("No, we will not be breaking into your bank account. A hackathon is…").

We have created [guides for three administrative groups](https://news.mlh.io/hackathon-guides-for-parents-and-administrators-09-10-2015) ([university representatives](https://mlh.io/college-administrator-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*1yk1xvp*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODA2LjAuMC4w), [high school faculty](https://mlh.io/high-school-administrator-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*880qeb*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODIwLjAuMC4w), and [parents](https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide?_gl=1*8xjjyd*_ga*MTA4NTA2NjQ4NS4xNzMzNDk1NjQx*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*MTc0MTcyMzg2NC4xMTkuMS4xNzQxNzI0ODUwLjAuMC4w)). These guides explain what a hackathon is, why it is beneficial for a school, and why it is beneficial for students. It also contains various resources that will be useful for university advocates to convince other faculty members.

In a short email to potential advocates, you can include:

* A brief definition of a hackathon. We like to explain it as weekend long invention competition.
* The most relevant guide from the list above.
* Videos and/or photos from past events.
* At least 3 ways students will _directly_ benefit from an on-campus hackathon.

[Frame your hackathon as a recruiting event with a twist. Your school most likely already hosts a recurring career fair -- you can pitch your event relative to this terminology to immediately align it with your school’s goals.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

## What If You Can't Find an On-Campus Location?

On rare occasions, students aren’t able to find a free on-campus venue. If that’s the case, you still have options:

* Research venues in your area that have held events of a similar size: other hackathons, conferences, etc. If you know someone who organized one of these events, ask for an introduction to their director.
* Approach several companies that stand to gain something by sharing their space with you, such as a tech company that recruits programmers and designers. Your short email introduction should include the same information you sent to potential on-campus advocates:
  * A brief definition of a hackathon.
    * Libraries are expanding to more than just physical books. Find one with a Makerspace who might be interested in getting more people to try it out! These are a great fit for any Hardware focused hackathons.&#x20;
  * Videos and/or photos of past events.
  * At least 3 ways students will _directly_ benefit from using this location.&#x20;

Whenever possible, **don’t fall into the trap of paying to rent a venue**. With additional and hidden charges, it could easily double the cost of your hackathon. In addition to the rental fee, you will be responsible for providing all of the infrastructure required to run a large event, including Internet wiring, table and chair rental, and your own security team.

If you really can’t find a free venue, look into renting a coworking space with most of this infrastructure in place.

### Double Check What Your Venue Provides

Before you book an event space, make sure it has everything you need help you host a successful hackathon. The list below covers some important considerations. [Refer to our venue checklist for the complete list!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRs6pM0mEetgIFJVvPr5pN5O3diOuTKuhbGZkWMb87c/edit?tab=t.0)

* **Overnight** — Is the venue aware that students will be staying overnight? Can hackers who need to sleep during the hackathon find a dedicated and safe place to do so?&#x20;
* **Enough capacity** — The average MLH hackathon is around 300 student hackers. Can the venue accommodate the number of attendees you plan to host?
* **The right physical space** — Your venue must have space for hackers to work and listen to speakers, as well as designated areas for hardware, food, sponsors, and MLH.
* **WiFi** — Can the WiFi support a large number of people in a condensed space? It should be able to handle 4 devices per hacker.&#x20;
* **Power** — Is there enough amperage for hundreds of computers, phones, and hardware devices? Assume you'll need at least 2.5 outlets per hacker.
* **A/V equipment and staff**— What A/V equipment is available? Does the venue offer staff to help you set it up?
* **Tables and chairs** — How many seats and tables do you need? Does the venue provide them, or do you need to rent from a separate vendor? Coordinate with your vendor to create a floor plan.
* **Food**— Does the venue offer catering? If it does, are you required to use it? How much will this cost?
* **Accessibility** — Can hackers in need of physical accommodation conveniently access the building?
* **Security** — Will there be a secure space where sponsors, organizers, and attendees can keep expensive equipment? Does the venue offer their own security, or do you need to find and pay for them?

If your venue lacks in some areas but is hosted on campus, you may be able to work with other branches of your administration to cover them. For example:

* Talk to your school's IT department about fortifying WiFi during your event or renting access points and switches. This can sometimes be done for free or with a security deposit. Supportive administration may help you set it up if requested.
* If you don't have access to the venue's fuse box, talk to the school's electricians to see if you can get special access or have one of them on site/on call.
* If you don't have enough extension cords or power strips, other organizations on campus may have them and be willing to lend them out. e.g. the organization that runs your school's career fair.

### Ask About Venue Requirements and Restrictions

Most venues come with their own specific list of rules and required fees. In addition to confirming what your venue provides, a few questions to ask during your initial meeting with the venue bookers include:

* Can the venue confirm and guarantee a financial ceiling for any of your quotes?
* Does the building require you to pay for catering, security, a fire marshal, janitors, etc.?
  * Is food required to be from their caterer or can you bring in outside food?
* Does the venue have a loading dock for deliveries?
* Are there specific security regulations you must abide by?
* Are you permitted to host an overnight event? It’s important to let the potential venue know that people will be working in the space overnight. The key word here is "working" -- in many instances, it is against fire code to allow attendees to sleep.&#x20;
* Does the venue require you or any sponsors attending to have insurance? Get the details and tell all parties you need this for as soon as possible.&#x20;

## MLH Tips

* Book early!
* Watch out for hidden fees and venue restrictions and requirements.
* Your venue should be free! Do everything in your power to ensure you don’t have to deal with the cost and logistical headache of paying for a space and everything that comes with it.
* Negotiate to reserve your venue for the day before so you have plenty of time to set up.
* **Make sure your space is aware your will be hosting an overnight event.**
