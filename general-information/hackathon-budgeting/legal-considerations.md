# Legal Considerations

There are several legal considerations you should be aware of when planning your event. If you are a student club, we recommend consulting with an advisor from your university or high school on the following legal topics before your event.&#x20;

* [ ] Donations&#x20;
  * Is our school a 501(c)(3) nonprofit? If so, can our team accept donations? How can we accept donations?
* [ ] Insurance
  * Will our event be covered by our school's event insurance? Do we need hackers to sign any agreements before participating in the event?
* [ ] Sponsor Agreements
  * Who at our school should we contact to sign legal agreements on our behalf? How long is the review process?
* [ ] Finance
  * Where will our funds be held? How can we access them? Are there any fees we should be aware of?&#x20;
  * Are there any tax requirements we should be aware of? Do we need to keep our receipts?

If your team is not a student club, we recommend consulting the MLH team to help you evaluate legal alternatives. &#x20;

One common alternative is working with a fiscal sponsor - an existing 501(c)(3) nonprofit - to get access to their tax-exemption status as well as their additional financial and legal benefits. The fiscal sponsors listed below are designed to support hackathon teams.&#x20;
