# Legal Considerations

There are several legal considerations you should be aware of when planning your event. If you are a student club, we recommend consulting with your university or high school on the following legal topics before your event.&#x20;

* [ ] Donations&#x20;
  * Is our school a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the United States, an approved institution under 80G and 80GGA in India or something similar in my country? If so, can our team accept donations? How can we accept donations?
* [ ] Insurance
  * Will our event be covered by our school's event insurance? Do we need hackers to sign any agreements before participating in the event?
* [ ] Sponsor Agreements
  * Who at our school should we contact to sign legal agreements on our behalf? How long is the review process?
* [ ] Finance
  * Where will our funds be held? How can we access them? Are there any fees we should be aware of?&#x20;
  * Are there any tax requirements we should be aware of? Do we need to keep our receipts?

If your team is not a student club, we recommend consulting the MLH team to help you evaluate legal alternatives. &#x20;

One common alternative is working with a fiscal sponsor - an existing nonprofit - to get access to their tax-exemption status as well as their additional financial and legal benefits. The fiscal sponsors listed below are designed to support hackathon teams.&#x20;
