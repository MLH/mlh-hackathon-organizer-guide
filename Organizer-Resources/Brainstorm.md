# Keeping Hackers Motivated

Participants need to have an idea for a hack and be making steady progress
toward their goals to stay motivated at your hackathon. While you don't want to
be overbearing or dictate what hackers should make, some hackers need more
support generating ideas and staying on track.

Here are some workshops and activities you can run to support these hackers
so they'll enjoy your hackathon more. The types of activities we'll cover in
this section are:

- [Brainstorming workshops](#brainstorming-workshop)
- [Pitch sessions](#pitch-session)
- [Check-in meetings](#check-in-meetings)

## Brainstorming Workshop

Brainstorming is the most important part of the hacker's experience at a
hackathon, and for some hackers, it's also the most difficult.

Usually, hackers take one of two approaches:

- **Start with a problem they want to solve** and then develop an idea to solve it.
  Hackers who want to focus on improving an aspect of their lives or hacking for
  social impact might prefer this route.
- **Start with a technology they want to use** in their hack and then develop a
  hack around it. Hackers who want to learn about a popular or emerging
  technology might prefer this route.

Running a hands-on workshop covering brainstorming techniques at the start of
your hackathon will enable them to hit the ground running. [Design thinking] is
a widely used, user-centered technique for generating and prototyping ideas to
solve problems that users face.

## Pitch Session

A pitch session is a structured event where hackers who have ideas for hacks
and are looking for teammates present their ideas to an audience. Typically,
presenters describe the problem or technology they want to design their hack
around and what skill set they're looking for. Hackers who are looking for teams
and have the matching skill set can offer to join the presenter.

## Check-in Meetings

Check-in meetings or standups give teams face-to-face contact with other teams
and a chance to report their progress and get help. At a check-in meeting, teams
take turns stating what their goals are, how much progress they've made,
what difficulties are impeding their progress, and what kind of help they need
from mentors and other teams at the hackathon. Consider running three to five
check-in meetings at regular intervals throughout your hackathon.
