# Introduction to Fundraising

It’s nearly impossible to host a serious hackathon without money. That said, landing quality sponsorship is manageable if you **break the process into small steps** and give yourself plenty of lead time. The more practice you get approaching and negotiating with potential backers, the better you’ll become at the art of fundraising.

With the **right communication and target**, you can expect a lot of positive response from the sponsors' side even for a digital hackathon. However, be diligent to communicate with your sponsors at every step of the process. Explain to them the **reasons** for making your event digital, outline how you will **support them** throughout the event, and let them **know about the success** at other digital events.

One thing to keep in mind as you work your way through this process: **sponsors are like investors — they want to see you’re serious before they give you capital**. In the same way, you wouldn’t approach a VC without a product prototype, don’t reach out to sponsors until you’ve got evidence that your hackathon is well on its way to happening: a confirmed date and time, pre-registrations from students, etc.
