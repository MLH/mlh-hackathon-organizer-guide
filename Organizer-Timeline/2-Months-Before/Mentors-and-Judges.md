# Book Mentors And Judges

You’ll need to recruit a variety of tech experts to mentor your attendees, speak at your event and judge your hackathon. Consider targeting:

* Experts from your school, including professors, deans, and alumni

* Local community leaders

* Reps from local tech companies

* Tech celebrities who have something to promote (best for bigger events)

Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges:

* It’s similar to the process of [contacting sponsors](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Timeline/4-Months-Before/Sponsorship/Land-Sponsorships.html).

* Consider who you know and who your school knows

* Have department heads reach out for you when helpful

## A Note About Judges

We recommend selecting judges that have a strong technical aptitude. If you’re planning to do Science Fair Judging and Presentations, your judges for each should be separate. For expo judging, ensure you have a minimum of one judge per thirty participants.

## MLH Tips

* Start close to home. Often your best chances at hosting strong speakers will come from personal and school connections.

* Consider recruiting a high-energy MC. [This person will be the face of the event to hackers and sponsors, so having someone who is excited about hacking with some public speaking experience helps hold the entire event together.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)
