# The 5-step MLH Sponsorship Process

Once you’ve ascertained how much money your hackathon needs and created your sponsorship materials, you’re ready to embark on the fundraising process.

## 1. Set Targets And Do Your Research

* Compile a list of potential sponsors:

    * Check out sponsors of previous MLH events

    * Search your network (LinkedIn is a great tool for this)

    * Check in with career services —  which companies sponsor tech job fairs on your campus?

    * Fundraising announcements

## 2. Get In Touch

* Send a well-crafted, thoughtful email.

    * Keep it clear and concise. Shorter is better.

    * Don’t attach the prospectus yet —  your goal here is simply to get to the next step: a phone call.

    * Cover the basics —  when, where, why, etc.

    * Ask for a short phone call on a specific date.

* Reach out to the decision maker at each company. When in doubt, email the CEO.

* Intros are infinitely better than cold emails.

* Follow up: don’t worry if you don’t receive a response to your initial email; wait a week and ask again.

## 3. Have An Exploratory Phone Call

* Make sure the sponsor knows what a hackathon is —  use analogies like comparing it to a science fair

* Ask about success metrics. What did they get from past sponsorships?

* Sell your team and your story. What makes you special?

* Let THEM do all the talking. You’ll figure out what companies most value this way.

* Don’t be afraid to ask their budget. "Given the times you’ve sponsored events similar to this one, what have you spent and what did you get?"

* Before you hang up, schedule a follow up call.

## 4. Make A Proposal

* Do this right away. Sometimes it’s as easy as sending over a prospectus with the packages most relevant to that particular company. Other times, you’ll have to put together a custom proposal.

* Make sure to explain why your offerings are a good fit.

* Give your sponsorship deadline.

* Less is more! Choose a uniform color scheme and keep text to a minimum on each slide.

## 5. Follow Up And Track Your Progress

* Email a week or two later offering to answer questions.

* Track your emails with a CRM, an email service like Boomerang, or plain old Excel.

* When a sponsor says yes, invoice them immediately.

## Tracking Your Incoming And Outgoing Funds

* Keep in mind that sponsorship money comes in on a rolling basis

* Develop a process for collecting and spending money. Ask about club accounts

* Have one person in charge of maintaining the budget, outstanding invoices, and accounts payable so that they understand when money is coming in and out

## MLH Tips

* Appoint one person to act as the point of contact for all sponsors (most likely your head of finance).

* Target local companies. [Typically sponsors who are located closer will be able to send more company reps, bring more stuff, and relate more to the hackers. ](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

* Be willing to negotiate offerings — to a point. It’s important to preserve the integrity of your hackathon.

* If rejected, ask for something else! Many companies that can’t contribute money are happy to send a judge or an onsite mentor.

* Under promise and over deliver so sponsors feel they got the most bang for their buck.

* Make sure you’ve got your taxes under control. We recommend speaking with an accountant.
