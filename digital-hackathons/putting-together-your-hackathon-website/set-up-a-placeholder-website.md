description: The first iteration of your Hackathon Website

# Placeholder Website

Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested students.

_Think about your hackathon as a movie. You first release a teaser, then a trailer and then on the eventful weekend, the movie releases! This website will serve as a teaser for your event - the first step to spark a huge interest in your hackathon._

### The first iteration of your site should include:

* **Event Date:** If you don't have an exact date, try to include at least the month of your hackathon.
* **A Pre-Registration Form:** Capture the initial interest of your hackers. Getting their name, email and some social channels can be a great starting point.
* **A Support Email:** You should be ready to answer potential attendees’ questions. This will have a great impact on the word of mouth marketing.
* **Social Handling:** Links to your event’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter account
* **Release Date:** A date when visitors should check back for more info
* **Frequently Asked Questions:** A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone who has never seen or been to a hackathon before.
* **Sponsor Interest Page:** A page just for sponsors, including:
  * An email address for sponsorship inquiries
  * Some information about your event and your team
