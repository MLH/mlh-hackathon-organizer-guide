## Go paperless!

Utilizing paper for any form of communication is not ideal, as it will
most likely end up in the trash. We want to completely eradicate the
usage of paper and stick to digital communication for little to no
paper wasted.

**Objective:**
- Only use digital communication.

**Key results:**
- Reduce printed handouts and documents by 100%.

**Action Items:**
- Keep promotional materials digital, including the agenda and information documents.
- Provide clear digital maps of the campus to hackers and sponsors.
