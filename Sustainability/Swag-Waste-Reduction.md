## Sponsor Swag Waste Reduction

Hackathons are known for loading their hackers with a bunch of sponsored swag.
Many times we can end up with loads of left over swag, which can go to waste.
Here are some things you should consider when asking sponsors for swag.

**Objective #1:**
- Reduce the amount of extra swag.

**Key results:**
- Have a maximum of 2% sponsor swag leftovers by the end of the hackathon.

**Action Items:**
- Swag leftovers can be distributed to hackers at the end of the closing ceremony.



**Objective #2:**
- Provide hackers more reusable items.

**Key Results:**
- Make the swag bag at least 80% eco-friendly.

**Action Items:**
- Ask sponsors for items like reusable plastic water bottles, reusable coffee cups, mugs, stainless steel straw.
- For prizes, using reusable bags not gifts bags and limit/eradicate excessive tissue paper.
