## Transportation

Having hundreds of hackers all drive individually to your event is taxing
to the environment, lets try to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible
by encouraging hackers to carpool.

**Objective:**
- Reduce environmental footprint by cutting down carbon emissions.

**Key results:**
- Have 80% of attendees report as carpooling or commuting.

**Action Items:**
- Use Facebook group and/or Slack channel to mention that there will be limited parking and maybe provide parking discount if carpooling with 3 or more hackers.
- Provide shuttle buses from centric places.
- Provide schedules of public transportation around campus, share links and common routes from campus.
- Put out post event surveys to collect information on how hackers commuted to the event.
