## Sustainable Swag-Guide
Swag is a massive part of hackathons. Companies may send in stickers, sunglasses,
pens, and many other novelty items to be distributed among the hackers. However, some of these items may never be used or end in the garbage,
so we encourage you to request sponsors for more reusable swag in order to ensure that everything we are giving out will be used multiple times.

Here is a guide you can send to companies when requesting swag for your event:
