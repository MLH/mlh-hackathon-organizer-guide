## Food Waste Reduction

Catering for hundreds of hackers is a difficult task. We can be tempted
to over-order as we don't want anyone sleeping on an empty stomach, however
this can sometimes leads to excessive left over food. We want to make sure all the extra food
gets eaten and not thrown away. Here are some things to consider when trying
to reduce food related waste.

**Objective #1:**
- Reduce the amount of food and packages waste.

**Key results:**
- Have a maximum of 3% food and package waste after every meal.

**Action Items:**
- Donate food leftovers to residence centers or communal student spaces within one hour after breakfast/lunch/dinner time to maintain the freshness of food.
- Ensure compost bins are available and visible for food waste.
- Provide maps of venue highlighting where the recycling/compost/garbage bins and water fountains are located. Because the location of the bins can change, we can keep an updated map in slack.
- Offer paper food takeaway containers when giving out food to avoid food waste, this will help reduce people throw food in the trash, by giving hackers the option to store and eat food at their own convenience.
- Microwaves should be all around campus to help them reheat the food.
- Get condiments in bulk rather than in small packaging.
- Encourage and remind hackers to bring reusable water bottles
- Get at least 95% of hackers confirmed at least one week prior to finalize numbers with the Catering companies, including special requests due to dietary restrictions and food allergies.
- Add double of the vegan, halal and gluten-free alternatives requested for last-minute hackers.
- Explain in opening ceremonies and registration package how and where to compost/recycle the materials that the hackathon is using



**Objective #2:**
- Increase the use of reusable utensils.

**Key Result:**
- Have 95% use of reusable utensils.

**Action Items:**
- Avoid use of straws, stir sticks, non-reusable containers, plastic packaging, etc.
- Notify the catering companies about our food waste reduction plan to encourage them to use reusable or biodegradable utensils and containers.
