# Wiki Races

## **You will need:**

* Access to Zoom/ Video streaming service
* Any web browser
* Code of Conduct appropriate articles to search for and SFW adjacent articles

## **Wikipedia Races:**

The objective of this game is to try to get to a target **W**ikipedia article as quickly as possible using only links from your starting article and without any searches. To start, the Coach or MLHer staffing the mini event will announce the “finish line”.

For example, let’s say Kevin announces the target article is “Texas Hold ‘Em.” After that, all participants will go to their Wikipedia homepage, and click on the “Random article” link on the left hand side and the races will begin!

At which point, you’ll get your starting article:

And after many control f’s and several clicks, we got to the endpoint!

Feel free to repeat the races as many times as time permits, as long as hackers are engaged and having fun.

## **Pro tips:**

* Countries are a very easy first race
* Narrow down to make it harder, such as a celebrity
* If hackers finish at the same time, use \# of clicks to clinch tiebreakers
